Apparently if:

- You are extending an S3 generic
- You are re-exporting that S3 generic
- That generic DOES have `...` at the end
- That S3 generic adds an argument BETWEEN other existing arguments
- Then your method will get a warning until you update to add that argument

```
> checking S3 generic/method consistency ... WARNING
  foo1:
    function(x, new, old, ...)
  foo1.character:
    function(x, old, ...)
  
  See section ‘Generic functions and methods’ in the ‘Writing R
  Extensions’ manual.
```

Here are the generics https://github.com/DavisVaughan/generictest


It is worth noting that if the `...` came earlier in the signature, like before the `new` and `old` arguments, then this would not have been an issue. See `foo5()`.
